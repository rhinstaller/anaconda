# Dockerfile to build Live iso with Anaconda from the repository.
# To find out how to build this container please look on the ./tests/README.rst file.
# This container has to be started as --privileged and with precreated loop devices otherwise
# lorax won't work correctly.
#
# Execution example:
#
# make -f ./Makefile.am container-rpms-scratch # Create Anaconda RPM in `pwd`/result/... directory.
# sudo make -f ./Makefile.am anaconda-live-iso-creator-build
#
# # /var/tmp tmpfs speeds up lorax and avoids https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1906364
# sudo podman run -i --rm --privileged --tmpfs /var/tmp:rw,mode=1777 -v `pwd`/result/build/01-rpm-build:/anaconda-rpms:ro -v `pwd`/output-dir:/images:z quay.io/rhinstaller/anaconda-live-iso-creator:main
#
# note:
# - add `--network=slirp4netns` if you need to share network with host computer to reach
#   repositories (VPN for example)
#

# The `image` arg will set base image for the build.
# possible values:
#   registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora:35
#   registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora:rawhide
#   registry-proxy.engineering.redhat.com/rh-osbs/ubi9:latest # private source
#   registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi # public source
ARG image
FROM ${image}
# FROM starts a new build stage with new ARGs. Put any ARGs after FROM unless required by the FROM itself.
