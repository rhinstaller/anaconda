"The most important change is that creation of new filesystems has been "

"volumes in stages (physical volume, then volume group, then logical volume) "
"-- now you just create a logical volume and we'll handle the legwork of "
"setting up the physical volumes and volume group to contain it. We'll also "

"\n"
"The left-hand side of the screen shows the OS installations we were able to "
"find on this computer. The new %(productName)s installation is at the top of "

"\n"
"Below the various installations and mountpoints on the left-hand side there "

"The right-hand side of the screen is where you can customize the currently-"

"How to create a new filesystem on a new device\n"
"\n"
"1. Click on the + button.\n"
"2. Enter the mountpoint and size. (Hint: Hover the mouse pointer over either "
"of the text entry areas for help.)\n"

"\n"
"You can change which disks a new device may be allocated from by clicking "

"\n"
"When adding a new mountpoint by clicking the + button, leave the size entry "
