       cancel, with a response ID of 0.  Otherwise, the kwarg named "buttons"
       should be a list of translated labels.  Each will have an incrementing
       response ID starting with 0, and any Quit button will be placed on the
       far left hand side of the dialog.  It's up to the caller of the "run"
       method to do something with the returned response ID.
