       configuration options that the user may choose from.  Each grid is
       provided by a SpokeCategory, and each option is provided by a Spoke.
       When the user dives down into a Spoke and is finished interacting with
       it, they are returned to the Hub.

       Some Spokes are required.  The user must interact with all required
       Spokes before they are allowed to proceed to the next stage of
       installation.

       From a layout perspective, a Hub is the entirety of the screen, though
       the screen itself can be roughly divided into thirds.  The top third is
       some basic navigation information (where you are, what you're
       installing).  The middle third is the grid of Spokes.  The bottom third
       is an action area providing additional buttons (quit, continue) or
       progress information (during package installation).

       Installation may consist of multiple chained Hubs, or Hubs with
       additional standalone screens either before or after them.

           in the anaconda class, as that would be a big mess.  Instead, a
           Hub may count on the following:

           ksdata       -- An instance of a pykickstart Handler object.  The
                           Hub uses this to populate its UI with defaults
                           and to pass results back after it has run.

                           determining what storage devices are present and how
                           they are configured.
           payload      -- An instance of a packaging.Payload subclass.  This
                           is useful for displaying and selecting packages to
                           install, and in carrying out the actual installation.
           instclass    -- An instance of a BaseInstallClass subclass.  This
                           is useful for determining distribution-specific
                           installation information like default package
