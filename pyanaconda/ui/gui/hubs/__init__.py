       configuration options that the user may choose from.  Each grid is
       provided by a SpokeCategory, and each option is provided by a Spoke.
       When the user dives down into a Spoke and is finished interacting with
       it, they are returned to the Hub.

       Some Spokes are required.  The user must interact with all required
       Spokes before they are allowed to proceed to the next stage of
       installation.

       From a layout perspective, a Hub is the entirety of the screen, though
       the screen itself can be roughly divided into thirds.  The top third is
       some basic navigation information (where you are, what you're
       installing).  The middle third is the grid of Spokes.  The bottom third
       is an action area providing additional buttons (quit, continue) or
       progress information (during package installation).

       Installation may consist of multiple chained Hubs, or Hubs with
       additional standalone screens either before or after them.
