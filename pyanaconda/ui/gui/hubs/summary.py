           The arguments this base class accepts defines the API that Hubs
           have to work with.  A Hub does not get free reign over everything
           in the anaconda class, as that would be a big mess.  Instead, a
           Hub may count on the following:

           ksdata       -- An instance of a pykickstart Handler object.  The
                           Hub uses this to populate its UI with defaults
                           and to pass results back after it has run.
           storage      -- An instance of storage.Storage.  This is useful for
                           determining what storage devices are present and how
                           they are configured.
           payload      -- An instance of a packaging.Payload subclass.  This
                           is useful for displaying and selecting packages to
                           install, and in carrying out the actual installation.
           instclass    -- An instance of a BaseInstallClass subclass.  This
                           is useful for determining distribution-specific
                           installation information like default package
                           selections and default partitioning.
