# The Red Hat subscription related tasks communicate over network and might

# to block either automated installation or the UI before they finish.
#
# These tasks (register + attach subscription and unregister) need to run in
# threads and these threads need to be started from at least two places:
# - from early startup code for automated installations
# - from Subscription spoke based on user interaction
#
# Also in some cases, multiple individual DBus tasks will need to be run
# in sequence with any errors handled accordingly.
#
# Anaconda modularity is not yet advanced enough to handle this in a generic
# manner, so we need simple scheduler living in the context of the main Anaconda
# thread. The simple scheduler hosts the code that starts the respective subscription
# handling thread, which assures appropriate tasks are run.
#
# As the scheduler code than can be run either during early startup or in reaction to user
# interaction in the Subscription spoke we avoid code duplication.
