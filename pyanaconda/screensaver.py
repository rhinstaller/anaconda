"""The screensaver inhibition module.

The "screensaver" term includes the following effects, none of which we want during installation:
- locking the screen
- turning off the screen
- suspending the system

See also the origin bz: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=928825

We are using the freedesktop D-Bus api for inhibiting the screensaver:
    https://people.freedesktop.org/~hadess/idle-inhibition-spec/re01.html

Note this does NOT use the systemd / logind API with similar name and capability!

The D-Bus api lives on the session bus. Connections to the session bus must be made with the
effective UID of the login user, which in live installs is not the UID of anaconda. This means
we need to call seteuid while creating the proxy and making calls on the bus.

Additionally, at the time of writing, creating the proxy actually starts the session bus daemon
and so creates the bus. Conversely, when the proxy stops existing, the bus goes down.

The inhibition is in effect only if all of these conditions are met:
- The process called Inhibit on the session bus for the correct user.
- The process exists.
- The session bus exists.
- The process did not call UnInhibit on the session bus with the right cookie.

Altogether this means that once the proxy is correctly created, we call Inhibit, and then
the proxy object must exist as long as we want the inhibition to be in effect.
