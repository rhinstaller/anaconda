        """ Create a new storage specification.  These are used to specify
            the default partitioning layout as an object before we have the
            storage system up and running.  The attributes are obvious
            except for the following:

            btr -- Should this be allocated as a btrfs subvolume?  If not,
                   it will be allocated as a partition.
            lv -- Should this be allocated as a logical volume?  If not,
                  it will be allocated as a partition.
            thin -- Should this be allocated as a thin logical volume if it is
                    being allocated as a logical volume?
            weight -- An integer that modifies the sort algorithm for partition
                      requests.  A larger value means the partition will end up
                      closer to the front of the disk.  This is mainly used to
                      make sure /boot ends up in front, and any special (PReP,
                      appleboot, etc.) partitions end up in front of /boot.
                      This value means nothing unless lv and btr are both False.
            required_space -- This value is only taken into account if
                             lv=True, and specifies the size in MiB that the
                             containing VG must be for this PartSpec to even
                             get used.  The VG's size is calculated before any
                             other LVs are created inside it.  If not enough
                             space exists, this PartSpec will never get turned
                             into an LV.
            encrypted -- Should this request be encrypted? For logical volume
                         requests, this is satisfied if the PVs are encrypted
                         as in the case of encrypted LVM autopart.
