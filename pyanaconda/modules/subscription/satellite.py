    Satellite instances usually have self signed certificates and also some tweaks
    are usually required in rhsm.conf to connect to a customer run Satellite instance
    instead of to Hosted Candlepin for subscription purposes.

    Each Satellite instance thus hosts a provisioning script available over plain
    HTTP that client machines can download and execute. This script has minimal dependencies
    and provisions the machine to be able to talk to the one given Satellite instance
    by installing it's self signed certificates and adjusting rhsm.conf.

    NOTE: As the script is downloaded over plain HTTP it is advised to ever only
          provision machines from a Satellite instance on a trusted network, to
          avoid the possibility of the provisioning script being tempered with

    Each Satellite instance provides a provisioning script that will

    This means that the self-signed certificates of the given
    Satellite instance will be installed to the system but also some
    necessary changes will be done to rhsm.conf.

    As we need to provision both the installation *and* target system
    to talk to Satellite we need to run the provisioning script twice,
    once in the installation environment and once on the target system.

    This is achieved by running this function first in the installation environment
    with run_on_target_system == False before a registration attempt.
    And then in the installation phase with run_on_target_system == True.

    Implementation wise we just always run the script from a tempfile.
