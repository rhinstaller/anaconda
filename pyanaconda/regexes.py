# Everyone has different ideas for what can go in a username. Here's ours:
# POSIX recommends that user and group names use only the characters within
# the portable filesystem character set (ASCII alnum plus dot, underscore,
# and hyphen), with the additional restriction that names not start with a
# hyphen. The Red Hat modification to shadow-utils starts with these rules
# and additionally allows a final $, because Samba.
#
# shadow-utils also defines length limits for names: 32 for group names,
# and UT_NAMESIZE for user names (which is defined as 32 bits/utmp.h). This
# expression captures all of that: the initial character, followed by either
# up to 30 portable characters and a dollar sign or up to 31 portable characters,
# both for a maximum total of 32. The empty string is not allowed. "root" is not
# allowed.

# a base expression without anchors, helpful for building other expressions
# If the string is the right length to match "root", use a lookback expression
# to make sure it isn't.
