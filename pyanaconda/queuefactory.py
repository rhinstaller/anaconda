class QueueFactory(object):
    """Constructs a new object wrapping a Queue.Queue, complete with constants
       and sending functions for each type of message that can be put into the
       queue.

       Creating a new object using this class is done like so:

           q = QueueFactory("progress")

       And then adding messages to it is done like so:

           q.addMessage("init", 0)
           q.addMessage("step", 1)

       The first call will create a new constant named PROGRESS_CODE_INIT and a
       method named send_init that takes zero arguments.  The second call will
       create a new constant named PROGRESS_CODE_STEP and a method named send_step
       that takes one argument.

       Reusing names within the same class is not allowed.
