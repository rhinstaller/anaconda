class InterfaceTemplate(ABC):
    """Template for DBus interface.

    This template uses a software design pattern called proxy.

    This class provides a recommended way how to define DBus interfaces
    and create publishable DBus objects. The class that defines a DBus
    interface should inherit this class and be decorated with @dbus_class
    or @dbus_interface decorator. The implementation of this interface will
    be provided by a separate object called implementation. Therefore the
    methods of this class should call the methods of the implementation,
    the signals should be connected to the signals of the implementation
    and the getters and setters of properties should access the properties
    of the implementation.

    Example:

    @dbus_interface("org.myproject.InterfaceX")
    class InterfaceX(InterfaceTemplate):
        def DoSomething(self) -> Str:
            return self.implementation.do_something()

    class X(object):
        def do_something(self):
            return "Done!"

    x = X()
    i = InterfaceX(x)
    i.publish("org/myproject/X/1")
