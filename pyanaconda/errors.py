# These constants are returned by the callback in the ErrorHandler class.
# Each represents a different kind of action the caller can take:
#
# ERROR_RAISE - This is a fatal error, and anaconda can do nothing but quit
#               or raise an exception.  This then feeds into the exception
#               handling framework.
#
# ERROR_CONTINUE - anaconda should continue with whatever it was going to do.
#                  This result comes from non-fatal errors, asking yes/no
#                  questions, and the like.
#
# ERROR_RETRY - This is a serious problem, but anaconda should attempt to
#               try again.  Continued failures may eventually result in an
#               ERROR_RAISE.

# TOP-LEVEL ERROR HANDLING OBJECT
###

class ErrorHandler(object):
    """This object makes up one part of anaconda's error handling system.  This
       part is the UI-agnostic error callback.  Throughout anaconda, various
       error conditions can occur in places that need to pop up a dialog, but
       should not know anything about the type or details of the UI.  In order
       to accomplish this, each pyanaconda.ui.UserInterface subclass presents a
       common set of dialog methods.

       The entry point to these methods is through the cb method of this class,
       which acts as a dispatcher to the appropriate handler, which in turn
       pops up the correct kind of dialog.  The result of all this is one of the
       ERROR_* constants defined elsewhere in this module.  The original calling
       code must then interpret this result and take the appropriate action.

       For details on the other parts of the error handling system, see the
       documentation for pyanaconda.ui.UserInterface and pyanaconda.exception.
