These are the boot options that are useful when starting Anaconda. For more
information refer to the appropriate Installation Guide for your release and
to the |anacondawiki|_.

Anaconda bootup is handled by dracut, so most of the kernel arguments handled
by dracut are also valid. See |dracutkernel|_ for details on those options.

Throughout this guide, installer-specific options are prefixed with
``inst`` (e.g. ``inst.ks``). Options specified without the ``inst`` prefix are
recognized, but the prefix may be required in a future release.

.. _repo:

Installation Source
-------------------

.. NOTE::
    An *installable tree* is a directory structure containing installer
    images, packages, and repodata. [#tree]_

    Usually this is either a copy of the DVD media (or loopback-mounted DVD
    image), or the ``<arch>/os/`` directory on the Fedora mirrors.

.. [#tree] an installable tree must contain a valid `.treeinfo` file
         for ``inst.repo`` or ``inst.stage2`` to work.

.. _inst.repo:

inst.repo
^^^^^^^^^

This gives the location of the *Install Source* - that is, the place where the
installer can find its images and packages. It can be specified in a few
different ways:

``inst.repo=cdrom``
    Search the system's CDROM drives for installer media. This is the default.

``inst.repo=cdrom:<device>``
    Look for installer media in the specified disk device.

``inst.repo=hd:<device>:<path>``
    Mount the given disk partition and install from ISO file on the given path.
    This installation method requires ISO file, which contains an installable tree.

``inst.repo=[http,https,ftp]://<host>/<path>``
    Look for an installable tree at the given URL.

``inst.repo=nfs:[<options>:]<server>:/<path>``
    Mount the given NFS server and path. Uses NFS version **3** by default.

    You can specify what version of the NFS protocol to use by adding ``nfsvers=X``
    to the `options`.

    This accepts not just an installable tree directory in the ``<path>`` element,
    but you can also specify an ``.iso`` file. That ISO file is then mounted and
    used as the installation tree. This is often used for simulating a standard
    DVD installation using a remote ``DVD.iso`` image.

.. _diskdev:

.. NOTE::
    Disk devices may be specified with any of the following forms:

    Kernel Device Name
        ``/dev/sda1``, ``sdb2``

    Filesystem Label
        ``LABEL=FLASH``, ``LABEL=Fedora``, ``CDLABEL=Fedora\x2023\x20x86_64``

    Filesystem UUID
        ``UUID=8176c7bf-04ff-403a-a832-9557f94e61db``

    Non-alphanumeric characters should be escaped with ``\xNN``, where
    'NN' is the hexidecimal representation of the character (e.g. ``\x20`` for
    the space character (' ').

.. inst.noverifyssl:

inst.noverifyssl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prevents Anaconda from verifying the ssl certificate for all HTTPS connections
with an exception of the additional kickstart repos (where --noverifyssl can be
set per repo).

.. inst.proxy:

inst.proxy
^^^^^^^^^^

``inst.proxy=PROXY_URL``

Use the given proxy settings when performing an installation from a
HTTP/HTTPS/FTP source.  The ``PROXY_URL`` can be specified like this:
``[PROTOCOL://][USERNAME[:PASSWORD]@]HOST[:PORT]``.

.. inst.stage2:

inst.stage2
^^^^^^^^^^^

This specifies the location to fetch only the installer runtime image;
packages will be ignored. Otherwise the same as `inst.repo`_.

.. inst.stage2.all:

inst.stage2.all
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All locations of type http, https or ftp specified with inst.stage2 will
be used sequentially one by one until the image is fetched. Other locations
will be ignored.

inst.dd
^^^^^^^

This specifies the location for driver rpms. May be specified multiple times.
Locations may be specified using any of the formats allowed for
`inst.repo`_.

inst.multilib
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This sets dnf's multilib_policy to "all" (as opposed to "best").

.. kickstart:

Kickstart
---------

.. inst.ks:

inst.ks
^^^^^^^

Give the location of a kickstart file to be used to automate the install.
Locations may be specified using any of the formats allowed for `inst.repo`_.

For any format the ``<path>`` component defaults to ``/ks.cfg`` if it is omitted.

For NFS kickstarts, if the ``<path>`` ends in ``/``, ``<ip>-kickstart`` is added.

If ``inst.ks`` is used without a value, the installer will look for
``nfs:<next_server>:/<filename>``

* ``<next_server>`` is the DHCP "next-server" option, or the IP of the DHCP server itself
* ``<filename>`` is the DHCP "filename" option, or ``/kickstart/``, and
  if the filename given ends in ``/``, ``<ip>-kickstart`` is added (as above)

For example:

* DHCP server: ``192.168.122.1``
* client address: ``192.168.122.100``
* kickstart file: ``nfs:192.168.122.1:/kickstart/192.168.122.100-kickstart``

.. inst.ks.all:

inst.ks.all
^^^^^^^^^^^

All locations of type http, https or ftp specified with inst.ks will be used
sequentially one by one until the kickstart file is fetched. Other locations
will be ignored.

.. inst.ks.sendmac:

inst.ks.sendmac
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add headers to outgoing HTTP requests which include the MAC addresses of all
network interfaces. The header is of the form:

* ``X-RHN-Provisioning-MAC-0: eth0 01:23:45:67:89:ab``

This is helpful when using ``inst.ks=http...`` to provision systems.

.. inst.ks.sendsn:

inst.ks.sendsn
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add a header to outgoing HTTP requests which includes the system's serial
number. [#serial]_

The header is of the form:

* ``X-System-Serial-Number: <serial>``

.. [#serial] as read from ``/sys/class/dmi/id/product_serial``

.. inst.ksstrict:

inst.ksstrict
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With this option, all warnings from reading the kickstart file will be
treated as errors. They will be printed on the output and the installation
will terminate immediately.

By default, the warnings are printed to logs and the installation
continues.

Network Options
---------------

Initial network setup is handled by dracut. For detailed information consult
|dracutnet|.

The most common dracut network options are covered here, along with some
installer-specific options.

.. ip:

ip
^^

Configure one (or more) network interfaces. You can use multiple ``ip``
arguments to configure multiple interfaces, but if you do you must specify an
interface for every ``ip=`` argument, and you must specify which interface
is the primary boot interface with `bootdev`_.

Accepts a few different forms; the most common are:

.. ip=ibft:

``ip=<dhcp|dhcp6|auto6|ibft>``
    Try to bring up every interface using the given autoconf method.  Defaults
    to ``ip=dhcp`` if network is required by ``inst.repo``, ``inst.ks``, ``inst.updates``,
    etc.

``ip=<interface>:<autoconf>``
    Bring up only one interface using the given autoconf method, e.g.
    ``ip=eth0:dhcp``.

``ip=<ip>::<gateway>:<netmask>:<hostname>:<interface>:none``
    Bring up the given interface with a static network config, where:

        ``<ip>``
            The client IP address. IPv6 addresses may be specified by putting
            them in square brackets, like so: ``[2001:DB8::1]``.

        ``<gateway>``
            The default gateway. IPv6 addresses are accepted here too.

        ``<netmask>``
            The netmask (e.g. ``255.255.255.0``) or prefix (e.g. ``64``).

        ``<hostname>``
            Hostname for the client machine. This component is optional.

``ip=<ip>::<gateway>:<netmask>:<hostname>:<interface>:<autoconf>:<mtu>``
    Bring up the given interface with the given autoconf method, but override the
    automatically obtained IP/gateway/etc. with the provided values.

    Technically all of the items are optional, so if you want to use dhcp but also
    set a hostname you can use ``ip=::::<hostname>::dhcp``.

.. nameserver:

nameserver
^^^^^^^^^^

Specify the address of a nameserver to use. May be used multiple times.

.. bootdev:

bootdev
^^^^^^^

Specify which interface is the boot device. Required if multiple ``ip=``
options are used.

.. ifname:

ifname
^^^^^^

``ifname=<interface>:<MAC>``
    Assign the given interface name to the network device with the given MAC. May
    be used multiple times.

.. NOTE::

    Dracut applies ifname option (which might involve renaming the device with
    given MAC) in initramfs only if the device is activated in initramfs stage
    (based on ip= option). If it is not the case, installer still binds the
    current device name to the MAC by adding HWADDR setting to the ifcfg file of
    the device.

.. inst.dhcpclass:

inst.dhcpclass
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set the DHCP vendor class identifier [#dhcpd]_. Defaults to ``anaconda-$(uname -srm)``.

.. [#dhcpd] ISC ``dhcpd`` will see this value as "option vendor-class-identifier".

.. inst.waitfornet:

inst.waitfornet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``inst.waitfornet=<TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS>``
    Wait for network connectivity at the beginning of the second stage of
    installation (after switchroot from early initramfs stage when the installer
    process is run).


Console / Display Options
-------------------------

.. console:

console
^^^^^^^

This is a kernel option that specifies what device to use as the primary
console. For example, if your console should be on the first serial port, use
``console=ttyS0``.

You can use multiple ``console=`` options; boot messages will be displayed on
all consoles, but anaconda will put its display on the last console listed.

Implies `inst.text`_.

.. inst.lang:

inst.lang
^^^^^^^^^

Set the language to be used during installation. The language specified must
be valid for the ``lang`` kickstart command.


.. inst.singlelang:

inst.singlelang
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install in single language mode - no interactive options for installation language
and language support configuration will be available.
If a language has been specified via the `inst.lang`_ boot option
or the `lang` kickstart command it will be used.
If no language is specified Anaconda will default to en_US.UTF-8.

.. inst.geoloc:

inst.geoloc
^^^^^^^^^^^

Configure geolocation usage in Anaconda. Geolocation is used to pre-set
language and time zone.

``inst.geoloc=0``
    Disables geolocation.

``inst.geoloc=provider_fedora_geoip``
    Use the Fedora GeoIP API (default).

``inst.geoloc=provider_hostip``
    Use the Hostip.info GeoIP API.

.. inst.geoloc-use-with-ks

inst.geoloc-use-with-ks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enable geolocation even during a kickstart installation (both partial and fully automatic).
Otherwise geolocation is only enabled during a fully interactive installation.

.. inst.keymap:

inst.keymap
^^^^^^^^^^^

Set the keyboard layout to use. The layout specified must be valid for use with
the ``keyboard`` kickstart command.

.. inst.cmdline:

inst.cmdline
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the installer in command-line mode. This mode does not
allow any interaction; all options must be specified in a kickstart file or
on the command line.

.. inst.graphical:

inst.graphical
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the installer in graphical mode. This is the default.

.. inst.text:

inst.text
^^^^^^^^^

Run the installer using a limited text-based UI. Unless you're using a
kickstart file this probably isn't a good idea; you should use VNC instead.

.. inst.noninteractive

inst.noninteractive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the installer in a non-interactive mode. This mode does not allow any
user interaction and can be used with graphical or text mode. With text
mode it behaves the same as the ``inst.cmdline`` mode.

.. inst.resolution:

inst.resolution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specify screen size for the installer. Use format nxm, where n is the
number of horizontal pixels, m the number of vertical pixels. The lowest
supported resolution is 800x600.

.. inst.vnc:

inst.vnc
^^^^^^^^

Run the installer GUI in a VNC session. You will need a VNC client application
to interact with the installer. VNC sharing is enabled, so multiple clients
may connect.

A system installed with VNC will start in text mode (runlevel 3).

.. inst.vncpassword:

inst.vncpassword
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set a password on the VNC server used by the installer.

.. inst.vncconnect:

inst.vncconnect
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``inst.vncconnect=<host>[:<port>]``
    Once the install starts, connect to a listening VNC client at the given host.
    Default port is 5900.

    Use with ``vncviewer -listen``.

.. inst.headless:

inst.headless
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specify that the machine being installed onto doesn't have any display
hardware, and that anaconda shouldn't bother looking for it.

.. inst.xdriver:

inst.xdriver
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specify the X driver that should be used during installation and on the
installed system.

.. inst.usefbx

inst.usefbx
^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the framebuffer X driver (``fbdev``) rather than a hardware-specific driver.

Equivalent to ``inst.xdriver=fbdev``.

.. inst.xtimeout:

inst.xtimeout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specify the timeout in seconds for starting X server.

.. inst.sshd:

inst.sshd
^^^^^^^^^

Start up ``sshd`` during system installation. You can then ssh in while the
installation progresses to debug or monitor its progress.

.. CAUTION::
    The ``root`` account has no password by default. You can set one using
    the ``sshpw`` kickstart command.

.. inst.decorated

inst.decorated
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run GUI installer in a decorated window. By default, the window is not decorated,
so it doesn't have a title bar, resize controls, etc.


Debugging and Troubleshooting
-----------------------------

.. inst.rescue:

inst.rescue
^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the rescue environment. This is useful for trying to diagnose and fix
broken systems.

.. inst.updates:

inst.updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Give the location of an ``updates.img`` to be applied to the installer runtime.
Locations may be specified using any of the formats allowed for ``inst.repo``.

For any format the ``<path>`` component defaults to ``/updates.img`` if it is
omitted.

.. inst.nokill:

inst.nokill
^^^^^^^^^^^

A debugging option that prevents anaconda from and rebooting when a fatal error
occurs or at the end of the installation process.

.. inst.loglevel:

inst.loglevel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``inst.loglevel=<debug|info|warning|error|critical>``
    Set the minimum level required for messages to be logged on a terminal (log
    files always contain messages of all levels). The default value is ``info``.

.. inst.noshell:

inst.noshell
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Do not put a shell on tty2 during install.

.. inst.notmux:

inst.notmux
^^^^^^^^^^^

Do not use tmux during install. This allows for output to get generated without
terminal control characters and is really meant for non-interactive uses.

.. inst.syslog:

inst.syslog
^^^^^^^^^^^

``inst.syslog=<host>[:<port>]``
    Once installation is running, send log messages to the syslog process on
    the given host. The default port is 514 (UDP).

    Requires the remote syslog process to accept incoming connections.

.. inst.virtiolog:

inst.virtiolog
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Forward logs through the named virtio port (a character device at
``/dev/virtio-ports/<name>``).

If not provided, a port named ``org.fedoraproject.anaconda.log.0``
will be used by default, if found.

See the |anacondalogging|_ for more info on setting up logging via virtio.

.. inst.zram:

inst.zram
^^^^^^^^^

Forces/disables (on/off) usage of zRAM swap for the installation process.


Boot loader options
-------------------

.. extlinux:

extlinux
^^^^^^^^

Use extlinux as the bootloader. Note that there's no attempt to validate that
this will work for your platform or anything; it assumes that if you ask for it,
you want to try.

.. leavebootorder:

leavebootorder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Boot the drives in their existing order, to override the default of booting into
the newly installed drive on Power Systems servers and EFI systems. This is
useful for systems that, for example, should network boot first before falling
back to a local boot.

.. inst.noblscfg:

inst.noblscfg
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Disable the use of the "BootLoader Spec" boot option configuration format with
GRUB.


Storage options
---------------

.. inst.nodmraid:

inst.nodmraid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Disable support for dmraid.

.. warning:: This option is never a good idea! If you have a disk that is
             erroneously identified as part of a firmware RAID array, that means
             it has some stale RAID metadata on it which must be removed using
             an appropriate tool (dmraid and/or wipefs).

.. inst.nompath:

inst.nompath
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Disable support for multipath devices. This is for systems on which a
false-positive is encountered which erroneously identifies a normal block device
as a multipath device. There is no other reason to use this option.

.. warning:: Not for use with actual multipath hardware!  Using this to attempt
             to install to a single path of a multipath is ill-advised, and not
             supported.

.. inst.gpt:

inst.gpt
^^^^^^^^

Prefer creation of GPT disklabels.


Other options
-------------

.. inst.selinux:

inst.selinux
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enable SELinux usage in the installed system (default). Note that when used as a
boot option, "selinux" and "inst.selinux" are not the same. The "selinux" option
is picked up by both the kernel and Anaconda, but "inst.selinux" is processed
only by Anaconda. So when "selinux=0" is used, SELinux will be disabled both in
the installation environment and in the installed system, but when
"inst.selinux=0" is used SELinux will only be disabled in the installed system.
Also note that while SELinux is running in the installation environment by
default, it is running in permissive mode so disabling it there does not make
much sense.

.. inst.nosave

inst.nosave
^^^^^^^^^^^

Controls what installation results should not be saved to the installed system,
valid values are: "input_ks", "output_ks", "all_ks", "logs" and "all".

``input_ks``
    Disables saving of the input kickstart (if any).

``output_ks``
    Disables saving of the output kickstart generated by Anaconda.

``all_ks``
    Disables saving of both input and output kickstarts.

``logs``
    Disables saving of all installation logs.

``all``
    Disables saving of all kickstarts and all logs.

Multiple values can be combined as a comma separated list, for example: ``input_ks,logs``

.. NOTE::
    The nosave option is meant for excluding files from the installed system that *can't*
    be removed by a kickstart %post script, such as logs and input/output kickstarts.

.. inst.nonibftiscsiboot

inst.nonibftiscsiboot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Allows to place boot loader on iSCSI devices which were not configured in iBFT.


Third-party options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since Fedora 19 the Anaconda installer supports third-party extensions called
*addons*. The *addons* can support their own set of boot options which should be
documented in their documentation or submitted here.

.. inst.kdump:

inst.kdump
++++++++++

``inst.kdump_addon=on/off``

Enable kdump anaconda addon to setup the kdump service.


Deprecated Options
------------------

These options should still be accepted by the installer, but they are
deprecated and may be removed soon.

.. method:

method
^^^^^^

This is an alias for `inst.repo`_.

repo=nfsiso:...
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The difference between an installable tree and a dir with an ``.iso`` file is
autodetected, so this is the same as ``inst.repo=nfs:``...

.. dns:

dns
^^^

Use `nameserver`_ instead. Note that ``nameserver`` does not
accept comma-separated lists; use multiple ``nameserver`` options instead.

.. netmask:
.. gateway:
.. hostname:

netmask, gateway, hostname
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These can be provided as part of the `ip`_ option.

ip=bootif
^^^^^^^^^

A PXE-supplied BOOTIF option will be used automatically, so there's no need

.. ksdevice:

ksdevice
^^^^^^^^

*Not present*
    The first device with a usable link is used

``ksdevice=link``
    Ignored (this is the same as the default behavior)

``ksdevice=bootif``
    Ignored (this is the default if ``BOOTIF=`` is present)

``ksdevice=ibft``
    Replaced with ``ip=ibft``. See `ip`_

``ksdevice=<MAC>``
    Replaced with ``BOOTIF=${MAC/:/-}``

``ksdevice=<DEV>``
    Replaced with `bootdev`_

Removed Options
---------------

These options are obsolete and have been removed.

.. askmethod:
.. asknetwork:

askmethod, asknetwork
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Anaconda's initramfs is now is completely non-interactive, so these have been
removed.

Instead, use `inst.repo`_ or specify appropriate `Network Options`_.

.. serial:

.. blacklist:
.. nofirewire:

blacklist, nofirewire
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``modprobe`` handles blacklisting kernel modules on its own; try
``modprobe.blacklist=<mod1>,<mod2>...``

You can blacklist the firewire module with ``modprobe.blacklist=firewire_ohci``.

serial
^^^^^^

This option was never intended for public use; it was supposed to be used to
force anaconda to use ``/dev/ttyS0`` as its console when testing it on a live
machine.

Use ``console=ttyS0`` or similar instead. See `console`_ for details.

.. updates:

updates
^^^^^^^

Use `inst.updates`_ instead.

.. essid:
.. wepkey:
.. wpakey:

essid, wepkey, wpakey
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dracut doesn't support wireless networking, so these don't do anything.

.. ethtool:

ethtool
^^^^^^^

Who needs to force half-duplex 10-base-T anymore?

.. gdb:

gdb
^^^

This was used to debug ``loader``, so it has been removed. There are plenty of
options for debugging dracut-based initramfs - see the |dracutdebug|.

.. inst.mediacheck:

inst.mediacheck
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the dracut option rd.live.check instead.

ks=floppy
^^^^^^^^^

We no longer support floppy drives. Try ``inst.ks=hd:<device>`` instead.

.. inst.display:

display
^^^^^^^

For remote display of the UI, use `inst.vnc`_.

.. utf8:

utf8
^^^^

All this option actually did was set ``TERM=vt100``. The default ``TERM`` setting
works fine these days, so this was no longer necessary.

.. noipv6:

noipv6
^^^^^^

ipv6 is built into the kernel and can't be removed by anaconda.

You can disable ipv6 with ``ipv6.disable=1``. This setting will be carried onto
the installed system.

.. upgradeany:

upgradeany
^^^^^^^^^^

Anaconda doesn't handle upgrades anymore.

.. inst.repo for installable tree:

inst.repo=hd:<device>:<path> for installable tree
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Anaconda can't use this option with installable tree but only with an ISO file.
