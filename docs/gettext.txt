gettext, i18n, and the po/ subdirectory

---------------------------------------

I have attempted to clean up our po/ subdirectory and bring it in to
conformance with GNU gettext tools as well as hook it in to GNU autoconf and
GNU automake.  The gettext software has templates set up for this already,
so I'm just using those.

From time to time, we may have to update our gettext template files and or
expand or reduce the information in the files.  How do you know what files
do what?  Here's an explanation:

ABOUT-NLS
config.rpath
m4/gettext.m4
m4/iconv.m4
m4/nls.m4
m4/po.m4
m4/...
po/Makefile.in.in
po/Makevars.template
po/Rules-quot
po/boldquot.sed
po/en@boldquot.header
po/en@quot.header
po/insert-header.sin
po/quot.sed
po/remove-potcdate.sin

    These files are copied in when 'autopoint' is run on the source
    project, which happens as part of autogen.sh.  In general, we should never
    need to touch these files.

    The autopoint tool depends on two macros in configure.ac: AM_GNU_GETTEXT,
    and AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION([<version>]). From time to time we may need to
    update the set of gettext files that we use. To do so, update the gettext
    version number in AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION and run autogen.sh. Be sure to
    also update the required gettext version in the spec file.

po/Makevars

    Should be updated when we update gettext files from autopoint with a new
    gettext version.  A file called po/Makevars.template will appear and we
    can move over our values to the new file and commit it.  We do not need to
    change this file on a regular basis.

po/POTFILES.in

    This file contains a listing of all source files in the project that
    have translatable strings.

    Some files can't be handled by gettext directly, such as the GNOME desktop
    files and anything without a clear filename extension. For these types of
    files, add a rule to po/Rules-extract to create a file that gettext can
    handle, and add the name of the generated file to po/POTFILES.in.

po/LINGUAS

    Space-delimited list of languages available.  If a new language is
    added, it should be added to this file.

po/Rules-extract

    Extra Makefile rules to process files that gettext can't handle on its
    own. The rules extract translatable strings to an intermediary file, and
    the name of the generated file is what goes in po/POTFILES.in.

po/anaconda.pot

    This is the template file built by xgettext containing all of the
    translatable strings. The file is updated and committed to git as part of
    building a release.

po/*.po

    Actual translated strings, as maintained by the translation team(s). These
    files are not stored in git. The po-pull target will pull the latest
    translations from Transifex.
