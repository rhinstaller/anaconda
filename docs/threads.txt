Threads in anaconda?  No!

INTRODUCTION

   Threads make a lot of people run screaming.  That's entirely
   understandable because thread concurrency can be a pain.  In this short
   document, I want to explain why threads are in anaconda and how to work
   with them in the code.

MISCONCEPTIONS

   Just to make sure everyone is on the same page, threads are similar to
   processes.  The big advantage we get is easier shared data structures.
   Threads can communicate over more methods than just signals.  But,
   multithreaded does not mean that we are taking every operation out to
   a separate thread.

ANACONDA THREADS

   The idea for anaconda threads is to simplify life for things that can
   or need to run parallel to other operations.  So we will reserve the
   use of threads for tasks that fit in to this category well (the logging
   system, for instance) and keep the bulk of the installer in the main
   thread.

THREADS AND PYTHON

   Python has a nice model for threading.  Threads in Python extend the
   threading.Thread class.  So an easy way to identify something that will
   run or can be run as a thread is seeing a class definition like this:

      class SomeClass(threading.Thread):

   You still have your __init__ method for the constructor, but threads
   also have a run() method and a join() method (there are others, but
   I will just discuss these).

   The run() method is called when you start the thread.  This is where
   you want to do the work.  Normally this happens in the class
   constructor, but in threads we need that separated out to a different
   method.

   The join() method is to block execution of other threads.  Whatever you
   put in the join() method will run and other threads will be blocked
   while it runs.  Now, this method is only run when you call it explicitly
   from another thread, so think of it as similar to waitpid().

   Python has the thread and threading modules.  Use threading as it's
   built on top of thread and provides a threading system similar to the
   POSIX thread model.

      http://docs.python.org/lib/module-threading.html

THREAD NAMES

   Threads have names in Python.  They are automatically assigned or you
   can specify the name.  For anaconda it probably makes more sense to
   name our threads since we won't be launching more than one for the
   same task.

   The convention I'm using is:  NameThr
   For example:  RelNotesThr

   The name is arbitrary, but we should probably have some sort of
   consistency.

PYGTK AND THREADS

   GTK+ presents the biggest challenge for threads, but it's not
   impossible. When you call gtk.main(), you need to call it like this:

      gtk.threads_enter()
      gtk.main()
      gtk.threads_leave()

   Calls to PyGTK methods or fiddling with GTK objects...all that has to
   be wrapped in threads_enter/threads_leave calls.  The suggested syntax
   is:

      gtk.threads_enter()
      try:
         # do stuff
      finally:
         gtk.threads_leave()

I will try to expand this document as I move through more threading code.
