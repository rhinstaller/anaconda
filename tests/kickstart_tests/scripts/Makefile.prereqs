# Use this Makefile and the prereqs() function to define any objects that need
# to be built for a particular kickstart test that could be shared by multiple
# tests. The Makefile is run with PWD = .../kickstart_tests/scripts. The
# following environment variables are available:
#
# IMAGE - the boot.iso
# KSTESTDIR - the absolute path to the kickstart_tests directory, sans scripts/
#
# This file is used before gaining root privileges but sudo probably works if
# you need it.

# This is a regular Makefile without any automake weirdness, so just keep it
# friendly.
