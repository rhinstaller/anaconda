# This Makefile is non-recursive so that all tests can easily be run with the
# same python environment. $top_srcdir and $top_builddir are added to the
# environment so that tests can get their bearings. Tests need to be aware that
# they may be run from within an arbitrary working directory.
# 
# While automake claims that it doesn't support wildcards anywhere, they really
# mean it with the parallel test harness. Rather than reverting back to the
# serial harness, all of the nosetests-based checks will be run serially by
# nosetests.sh. This script can be run in parallel with the other test scripts,
# such as pylint.
#
# nosetests will be run for any python files found in a directory matching *_tests
