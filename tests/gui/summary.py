# This test case handles the case where everything on the summary hub
# works as intended.  On this spoke, we are testing the following:
#
# * Clicking the Quit button brings up a dialog asking if you're sure, though
#   we're not going to test that confirming actually quits.
# * The Begin Installation button is insensitive, since no disks have yet
#   been selected.
# * Only the Date & Time, Keyboard, Installation Destination, and Network Config
#   spoke selectors are visible.
