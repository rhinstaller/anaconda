class UITestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    """A UITestCase is a class that incorporates all the test functions for a
       single anaconda Hub or Spoke window.  Moving to the window, and dealing
       with what happens after we move away is left up to whatever wraps up
       all the test cases.  A single Hub or Spoke may have multiple instances
       of this class - one may test the assumption that everything works as it
       should, while another may test that a specific initial setup fails in
       an expected way, and another may attempt fuzz testing on all entries on
       the screen.  However, a single TestSuite will only have one instance
       for each anaconda window.

       Some basic assumptions about the existence of UI elements are made in
       UITestCase subclasses.  If an element is required to be there (for
       instance, a button we are going to click) we simply grab the element
       with the exception-raising dogtail functions and call click on it.
       If the element does not exist, the exception will be propagated up and
       fail the test.  If we are testing for the existence of some element
       (for instance, that a dialog was displayed after a button was clicked)
       then we use UITestCase.find and the unittest.assert* functions.

       This is kind of subtle, but look at existing test cases for examples.

       Due to the unusual nature of running such a large program as anaconda
       in a test suite, combined with the special environment, tests are
       organized inside a UITestCase as follows:

       * Testing one little piece of the window is handled by a check_*
         function.  These are explicitly not named test_* as that is special
         to unittest.

       * Multiple check_* functions are called linearly in the _run method,
         which is used instead of runTest for error handling purposes.
