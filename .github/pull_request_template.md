**Thank you** for your contribution!

Please check that your PR follows these rules:

* [ ] [**Code conventions**](https://anaconda-installer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#code-conventions). tl;dr: Follow PEP8, wrap at 100 chars, and provide docstrings.

* [ ] [**Commit message conventions**](https://anaconda-installer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/commit-log.html). tl;dr: Heading, empty line, longer explanations, all wrapped manually. If in doubt, write a longer commit message with more details.

* [ ] **Tests** pass and cover your changes. You can [run tests locally manually](https://anaconda-installer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testing.html), or have them run as part of the PR. A team member will have to enable tests manually after inspecting the PR.
  *If you don't know how, ask us for help!*

* [ ] [**Release notes**](https://anaconda-installer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#release-notes) and **docs** if the PR adds something major or changes existing behavior.
  *If you don't know how, ask us for help!*

* [ ] **RHEL** rules: If your PR is for a `rhel-*` branch, pay special attention to commit messages. Make sure **all** commit messages include a line linking the commit to a bug, such as `Resolves: RHEL-123456`. For more information, see [the complete rules](https://anaconda-installer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/commit-log.html).
  *If you don't know how, ask us for help!*

Don't forget - *if you don't know how, ask us for help!*
