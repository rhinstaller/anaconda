# This is different from container rebuilds, where the tests "gate" the new version. The last
# container is used, always. That means, failures for this workflow signal breakages that are
# unrelated to the actual container builds.
#
# This should help as an additional data source to diagnose issues when things "randomly fail
# everywhere". Tests running here are not affected by any changes. In all other cases, these tests
# run after a change:
#    - code changes on PRs
#    - after container rebuilds
#    - after merges
#
# Ideally, these tests run on the same hashes as the merge tests, and so help detect which
# differences actually matter for the breakage.
#
# Warning: This differs from the pull request tests, both steps and matrix. Don't copypaste.
