# Dependabot will check our GitHub actions and if there will be a new version of any action
# Dependabot will create a pull request to update these.
#
# FIXME: Unfortunately, the Dependabot is checking only the default branch right now.
#        Could be solved by https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/2511.
