/**
 * SECTION: SpokeWindow
 * @title: AnacondaSpokeWindow
 * @short_description: Window for displaying single spokes
 *
 * A #AnacondaSpokeWindow is a widget that displays a single spoke on the
 * screen.  Examples include the keyboard and language configuration screens
 * off the first hub.
 *
 * The AnacondaSpokeWindow consists of two areas:
 *
 * - A navigation area in the top of the screen, inherited from #AnacondaBaseWindow
 *   and augmented with a button in the upper left corner.
 *
 * - An action area in the rest of the screen, taking up a majority of the
 *   space.  This is where widgets will be added and the user will do things.
